### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

How are you doing? My name is Pau, I am a Junior Data Scientist currently based in London (UK). 

If you are seeing this, _**welcome to my porfolio!**_ In it, I showcase most of the skills I have learned in my path as a coder. Pinned below this README you can see some of my favourite projects. I recommend you start by reading the CryptoPunks Project, an NFT financial viability analysis where the mastery of various  technologies is showcased. 

Otherwise, you can find all my other repositories ordered by difficulty from Sprint 2 to 19. Happy coding!
